## 💠 Dataset

* Name of Dataset: Mushroom Data Set
* Dataset Used: [Link of Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)
* No. of rows in the dataset = 8124 {No. of Instances}
* No. of columns in the datset = 22 {No. of Attributes}

## 💠 Tasks Performed:

⭐ TASK-1 -> Download dataset (having rows between 5K and 30K)

⭐ TASK-2 -> Pre-Process the Dataset

⭐ TASK-3 -> Generate 10 different samples

⭐ TASK-4 -> Divide the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing

⭐ TASK-5 -> Optimise the SVM for every sample with 10 iterations and report the best parmeters

⭐ TASK-6 -> Plot the convergence graph for the sample with maximum accuracy

## 💠 Results:



## 💠 Convergence graph for Best Sample:
